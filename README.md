# AI-Enhanced Electronic Health Records (EHR) System

## 🏥 Overview

This project revolutionizes traditional Electronic Health Records (EHR) by integrating cutting-edge Generative AI capabilities for automated medical imaging analysis and clinical documentation. Our system enhances the clarity and interpretability of medical images including X-rays, MRI, and CT scans, while significantly reducing the manual documentation burden on clinicians through intelligent auto-generated structured notes and automated ICD-10 coding.
