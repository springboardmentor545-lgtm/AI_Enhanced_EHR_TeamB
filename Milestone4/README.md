# AI‑Enhanced EHR Imaging & Documentation System

## Milestone 4 – Streamlit‑Based EHR Dashboard

---

## Project Overview

Milestone 4 focuses on the implementation of a web‑based Electronic Health Record (EHR) dashboard using Streamlit.

The objective of this milestone is to integrate outputs generated from previous milestones—such as enhanced medical images, structured clinical summaries, and ICD‑10 codes—into a single interface for patient record visualization.

---

## Scope of Milestone 4

This milestone implements a browser‑based EHR interface that allows users to view and interact with patient clinical data in a structured and organized manner.

The system integrates clinical text data and medical imaging outputs and presents them through an interactive dashboard.

---

## Functionalities Implemented

### Patient Selection
- Dropdown‑based selection of patient records (e.g., `EHR_01`, `EHR_02`)
- Dynamic loading of patient‑specific information

### Clinical Summary View
Displays structured clinical information including:
- Chief Complaint  
- Medical History  
- Diagnosis  
- Treatment Plan  
- ICD‑10 Code  

Data is sourced from processed EHR records.

### Medical Imaging View
- Displays enhanced medical images generated in earlier milestones
- Fallback handling when an image is not linked to a patient record

### Raw EHR Data View
- Displays raw EHR data in JSON format
- Enables inspection of underlying patient information
